# Bio Objects
Bio Objects is a library which can be used as a replacement for **Java Beans**. Bio Objects are based on Maps (Keys-Values) and you will only need to extend ```BioObject``` class and add necessary annotations. Bio Dictionary will be built based on @annotations or xml configuration and will contain all information required for serialization, xml/json parsing etc. 

**Bio Objects** are very useful in conjunction with **Bio Expressions** where you can write dynamic decision making mechanisms for your application. Such as :
- if		```car.year_of_production > 2015 and car.engine * 2 < 6000``` 		do this
- else if 	```car.fuel_efficiency.checkEUStandard()``` 				do this
- else if 	```car.calculateHP(car.cylinders, car.engine) > 200``` 			do this
- else if 	```4 < car.cylinders <= 6 and car.fuel_efficiency < 15.4```		do this
- else if 	```?car.producer and car.producer = ['BMW', 'Toyota']``` 		do this

if ```car``` object contains a tag ```producer``` and it is equal to any of the elements of array.

Here is simple definition of Bio Object
```java
@BioObj
public class Car extends BioObject {
  @BioTag(type="Integer")
  public static final String YEAR_OF_PRODUCTION = "year_of_production" ;
  @BioTag(type="String")
  public static final String PRODUCER = "producer" ;
  @BioTag(type="Double")
  public static final String FUEL_EFFICIENCY = "fuel_efficiency" ;
}
```

## Cool Features
- Easily customizable by adding new keys to map, without changing your code.
- Fast and efficient serialization/deserialization
- Binary compression and encryption after serialization
- Easy XML mapping from/to XML file
- Easy JSON mapping from/to JSON file
- Additional operations on Map such as trim(), clone(), format(), fill() (see below for details)
- Immutability support
- **Fast Expression Language evaluation (10x faster than SpEL)**

Bio Objects are easy solution where Model objects are changed frequently and developers don't want to change main code each time. Also it contains some additional functionalities which are very helpful.
